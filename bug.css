The following CSS code snippet exhibits an unusual error: It uses an invalid property 'font-size-adjust'. This property is non-standard and not supported by most browsers.  It's meant to maintain the x-height of text when the font changes, but its lack of broad support renders it unreliable.

```css
div {
  font-size-adjust: 0.5;
}
```
